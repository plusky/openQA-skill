# openQA-skill

Agent skills for working with [openQA](https://open.qa): writing tests and reviewing results.

The skills are plain Markdown plus small Python helper scripts, so they work with any coding agent that can
read files and run shell commands. Harnesses that implement the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io)
format pick up the `SKILL.md` frontmatter directly.

## Skills

| Skill | Use it when | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [`openqa`](skills/openqa/SKILL.md) | writing, scheduling, running or fixing an openQA test; asking why a job failed; reviewing a job group or build | **Create**: test modules for os-autoinst-distri-opensuse or a custom test distribution, needles, YAML schedules, verification runs, pull requests that pass review. **Review**: triage a failed or incomplete job from its artifacts, sweep a group or build, classify product bug / test issue / infrastructure / sporadic, draft bug reports and comments that openQA parses as references. |

One skill covers both jobs on purpose: they share the openQA model, the failure-triage method, the cloning
recipes and most scripts, and they hand over to each other (a review finds a test issue, a verification run
needs triage).

## Layout

```
skills/openqa/
  SKILL.md        entry point: shared rules, block routing, core directives
  references/     depth, read one section at a time (scripts/refsection.py)
  scripts/        helpers that print compact digests and never write to openQA; catalogue in scripts/README.md
  agents/         delegation playbooks: role prompts for sub-agents, also usable as standalone session prompts
                  (their frontmatter is metadata for harnesses that register agents from files)
tests/openqa/     script tests with offline fixtures
tests/repo/       repository gate: frontmatter, byte budgets, pointer resolution, content checks, cited flags
evals/openqa/     evaluation prompts
```

Tests and evals live outside the skill directory because installers copy the skill directory verbatim.
A skill never references files outside its own directory.

## Install

Requirements: Python 3.9 or newer (standard library only; PyYAML is used when present). Writing to an openQA
instance additionally needs `openqa-cli` / `openqa-clone-job` and an API key; the bundled scripts only ever
read from openQA.

Any harness, with an installer:

```
npx skills add plusky/openQA-skill --skill openqa -g
gh skill install plusky/openQA-skill openqa --scope user
```

Without `-g` / `--scope user` both install into the current project (`./.agents/skills/`), for example into a
test-repository checkout.

Manual, tracking the git checkout:

```
git clone https://github.com/plusky/openQA-skill.git
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills ~/.claude/skills
ln -s "$PWD/openQA-skill/skills/openqa" ~/.agents/skills/openqa
ln -s ../../.agents/skills/openqa ~/.claude/skills/openqa      # Claude Code
```

opencode, picking up every skill in this repository:

```json
{ "skills": { "paths": ["~/src/openQA-skill/skills"] } }
```

Use one install method only: harnesses that scan several directories report duplicate names, and
`npx skills add -g` repoints the agent directories at its own pinned copy, so a checkout you symlinked by hand
stops being what the agent reads.
The link or directory name must stay `openqa`: the Agent Skills format requires the directory to equal the
skill name. A harness without skill support can simply be pointed at `skills/openqa/SKILL.md`.

## Safety model

- **Read-only by construction.** The bundled API scripts can only issue GET requests, never send a `Referer`
  header and never read API keys. Anything that changes state (posting jobs, comments, labels, pushes,
  tickets) is an explicit command shown to the user and approved per action.
- **Third-party text is data.** What the bundled scripts print from jobs, tickets and PRs passes through a
  sanitiser: multi-line text (comments, step text, log excerpts, ticket bodies) is fenced with a fresh random
  nonce per block, short values are quoted. The fence marks, it does not decide: quoted values and whatever
  other tools fetch (tracker pages, PR text, repository files) are data all the same. The policy is
  `skills/openqa/references/untrusted-content.md`.
- **Generic mechanics only.** Which groups to watch, where bugs go and who approves what is site policy. It
  lives in a file you maintain outside this repository: `$OPENQA_SKILL_POLICY`, `./.openqa-policy.md` or
  `~/.config/openqa-skill/policy.md`; `skills/openqa/references/site-policy.md` has the template.
